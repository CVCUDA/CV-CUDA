v0.11.0-beta
============

Release Highlights
------------------

CV-CUDA v0.11.0 includes critical bug fixes alongside the following changes:​

* **New Features**:​

  * Enable NVCV to be built as static library​
  * Improve Python doc generation and structure ​

* **Bug Fixes**:​

  * Update pybind11 2.10.0 to 2.13.1. Fixes rare race conditions with Python garbage collector, adds compatibility with numpy2​

Compatibility and Known Limitations
-----------------------------------
  
* **Pre-existing limitations**:

  * We note a bug in the YUV(420) color conversion API (NVCV_COLOR_RGB2YUV_I420) which incorrectly computes the U and V plane index​

    * This persists through this release and we intend to address this bug in CV-CUDA v0.12.0​

.. [1] These fixes and features add micro-second-level overhead to Python operator calls. Based on the performance analysis of our Python samples, we expect the production- and pipeline-level impact to be negligible. CUDA kernel and C++ call performance is not affected. We aim to investigate and reduce this overhead further in a future release.​
