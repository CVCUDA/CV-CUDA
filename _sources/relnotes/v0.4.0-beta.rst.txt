v0.4.0-beta
===========

CV-CUDA 0.4.0 is a major release of the library providing multiple new operators, Jetson Orin support, and updated API documentation.


Release Highlights
------------------

CV-CUDA v0.4.0 includes the following key features:

* 14 new image processing and computer vision operators
  - Advanced Color Format Conversion
  - Brightness_Contrast
  - Color_Twist
  - FindContours
  - GaussianNoise
  - Histogram
  - Histogram Equalizer
  - Inpainting
  - MinAreaRect
  - MinMaxLoc
  - Morphology (Open, Close)
  - On-screen display (Polyline, Point, Line, Text, Rotated Rectangle, Segmented Mask)
  - RandomResizedCrop
  - SIFT
* Updated sample application
  - Streamed Triton-based Video Segmentation Sample using CV-CUDA and VPF (Video Processing Framework) optimized for performance with video decode/encode on server-side
* Added Jetson Orin support for core library
* Updated API documentation


Compatibility
-------------

CV-CUDA has been tested on the following compute stack

* GPU Compute Capability: 7+.x
* Ubuntu x86_64: 20.04, 22.04
* CUDA Toolkit: 11.7+ (11.2+ for library build and run)
* GCC: 11.0+ (9.0 and 10.0 for APIs, with pre-built binary and run)
* Python: 3.7, 3.8, 3.10

Refer to documentation of the sample applications for dependencies.


Known Issues/Limitations
------------------------

* Samples fails for encoding surfaces on T4 with CUDA 11.8 and display driver 520. Suggested workaround is to upgrade to a newer driver 525+.
* For GCC versions lower than 11.0, C++17 support needs to be enabled when compiling CV-CUDA.
