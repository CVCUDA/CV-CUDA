v0.5.0-beta
===========

CV-CUDA 0.5.0 is a comprehensive update introducing new security, compliance, and performance enhancements, alongside bug fixes and new features.

Release Highlights
------------------

CV-CUDA v0.5.0 includes significant improvements:

* **New Operators**:
  - FindHomography: Calculates a perspective transform from four pairs of the corresponding points
  - Label: Labels connected regions in an image using 4-way connectivity for foreground and 8-way for background pixels
  - PairwiseMatcher: Matches features computed separately (e.g. via the SIFT operator) in two images using the brute force method

* **New Features**:
  - Implemented Python class for `TensorBatch``, a container type that can hold a list of non-uniformly shaped tensors
  - Added support for RGBD image formats
  - Enhanced documentation

* **Bug Fixes**:
  - Resolved memory leak in NvBlurBoxes
  - Fixed segmentation fault issue in Python with certain imports
  - Corrected typestr format issue in `__cuda_array_interface__`
  - Addressed occasional hanging in OpBoxBlur on RGBA images
