CV-CUDA is an open-source project that enables building efficient cloud-scale
Artificial Intelligence (AI) imaging and computer vision (CV) applications. It
uses graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration to help developers build highly
efficient pre- and post-processing pipelines. CV-CUDA originated as a
collaborative effort between [NVIDIA][NVIDIA Develop] and [ByteDance][ByteDance].

Refer to our [Developer Guide](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for more information on the
operators available.

## Getting Started

### Known limitations and issues

- For GCC versions lower than 11.0, C++17 support needs to be enabled when compiling CV-CUDA.
- The C++ test module cannot build with gcc<11 (requires specific C++-20 features).  With gcc-9 or gcc-10, please build with option `-DBUILD_TESTS=0`
- [CV-CUDA Samples] require driver r535 or later to run and are only officially supported with CUDA 12.
- Only one CUDA version (CUDA 11.x or CUDA 12.x) of CV-CUDA packages (Debian packages, tarballs, Python Wheels) can be installed at a time. Please uninstall all packages from a given CUDA version before installing packages from a different version.
- Documentation built on Ubuntu 20.04 needs an up-to-date version of sphinx (`pip install --upgrade sphinx`) as well as explicitly parsing the system's default python version ` ./ci/build_docs path/to/build -DPYTHON_VERSIONS="<py_ver>"`.
- The Resize and RandomResizedCrop operators incorrectly interpolate pixel values near the boundary of an image or tensor when using cubic interpolation. This will be fixed in an upcoming release.
- The CvtColor operator incorrectly computes the data location of the second chromaticity channel for conversions that involve YUV(420) semi-planar formats. This issue persists through the current release and we intend to address this bug in CV-CUDA v0.12. We do not recommend using these formats.​

### Installation

For convenience, we provide pre-built packages for various combinations of CUDA versions, Python versions and architectures [here][CV-CUDA GitHub Releases].
The following steps describe how to install CV-CUDA from such pre-built packages.

We support two main alternative pathways:
- Standalone Python Wheels (containing C++/CUDA Libraries and Python bindings)
- DEB or Tar archive installation (C++/CUDA Libraries, Headers, Python bindings)

Choose the installation method that meets your environment needs.

#### Python Wheel File Installation

Download the appropriate .whl file for your computer architecture, Python and CUDA version from the release assets of current CV-CUDA release. Release information of all CV-CUDA releases can be found [here][CV-CUDA GitHub Releases]. Once downloaded, execute the `pip install` command to install the Python wheel. For example:
   ```shell
   pip install cvcuda_<cu_ver>-<x.x.x>-cp<py_ver>-cp<py_ver>-linux_<arch>.whl
   ```

where `<cu_ver>` is the desired CUDA version, `<x.x.x>` is the CV-CUDA release version, `<py_ver>` is the desired Python version and `<arch>` is the desired architecture.

Please note that the Python wheels are standalone, they include both the C++/CUDA libraries and the Python bindings.

#### DEB File Installation

Install C++/CUDA libraries (cvcuda-lib*) and development headers (cvcuda-dev*) using `apt`:
```shell
sudo apt install -y ./cvcuda-lib-<x.x.x>-<cu_ver>-<arch>-linux.deb ./cvcuda-dev-<x.x.x>-<cu_ver>-<arch>-linux.deb
```

Install Python bindings (cvcuda-python*) using `apt`:
```shell
sudo apt install -y ./cvcuda-python<py_ver>-<x.x.x>-<cu_ver>-<arch>-linux.deb
```
where `<cu_ver>` is the desired CUDA version, `<py_ver>` is the desired Python version and `<arch>` is the desired architecture.

#### Tar File Installation

Install C++/CUDA libraries (cvcuda-lib*) and development headers (cvcuda-dev*):
```shell
tar -xvf cvcuda-lib-<x.x.x>-<cu_ver>-<arch>-linux.tar.xz
tar -xvf cvcuda-dev-<x.x.x>-<cu_ver>-<arch>-linux.tar.xz
```
Install Python bindings (cvcuda-python*)
```shell
tar -xvf cvcuda-python<py_ver>-<x.x.x>-<cu_ver>-<arch>-linux.tar.xz
```
where `<cu_ver>` is the desired CUDA version, `<py_ver>` is the desired Python version and `<arch>` is the desired architecture.


### Build from Source

Follow these instruction to build CV-CUDA from source:

#### 1. Set up your local CV-CUDA repository

Install the dependencies needed to setup up the repository:
- git
- git-lfs: to retrieve binary files from remote repository

On Ubuntu >= 20.04, install the following packages using `apt`:
```shell
sudo apt install -y git git-lfs
```

Clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/CVCUDA/CV-CUDA.git
```

Assuming the repository was cloned in `~/cvcuda`, it needs to be properly configured by running the `init_repo.sh` script only once.

```shell
cd ~/cvcuda
./init_repo.sh
```

#### 2. Build CV-CUDA

Install the dependencies required to build CV-CUDA:
- g++-11: compiler to be used
- cmake (>= 3.20), ninja-build (optional): manage build rules
- python3-dev: for python bindings
- libssl-dev: needed by the testsuite (MD5 hashing utilities)
- CUDA toolkit
- patchelf

On Ubuntu >= 20.04, install the following packages using `apt`:
```shell
sudo apt install -y g++-11 cmake ninja-build python3-dev libssl-dev patchelf
```

Any version of the 11.x or 12.x CUDA toolkit should work.
CV-CUDA was tested with 11.7 and 12.2, these versions are thus recommended.

```shell
sudo apt install -y cuda-11-7
# or
sudo apt install -y cuda-12-2
```

Build the project:
```shell
ci/build.sh [release|debug] [output build tree path] [-DBUILD_TESTS=1|0] [-DPYTHON_VERSIONS='3.8;3.9;3.10;3.11'] [-DPUBLIC_API_COMPILERS='gcc-9;gcc-11;clang-11;clang-14']
```

- The default build type is 'release'.
- If output build tree path isn't specified, it will be `build-rel` for release
      builds, and `build-deb` for debug.
- The library is in `build-rel/lib` and executables (tests, etc...) are in `build-rel/bin`.
- The `-DBUILD_TESTS` option can be used to disable/enable building the tests (enabled by default, see Known Limitations).
- The `-DPYTHON_VERSIONS` option can be used to select Python versions to build bindings and Wheels for. By default, only the default system Python3 version will be selected.
- The `-DPUBLIC_API_COMPILERS` option can be used to select the compilers used to check public API compatibility. By default, gcc-11, gcc-9, clang-11, and clang-14 is tried to be selected and checked.

#### 3. Build Documentation

Known limitation: Documentation built on Ubuntu 20.04 needs an up-to-date version of sphinx (`pip install --upgrade sphinx`) as well as explicitly parsing the system's default python version ` ./ci/build_docs path/to/build -DPYTHON_VERSIONS="<py_ver>"`.

Install the dependencies required to  build the documentation:
- doxygen: parse header files for reference documentation
- python3, python3-pip: to install some python packages needed
- sphinx, breathe, recommonmark, graphiviz: to render the documentation
- sphinx-rtd-theme: documentation theme used

On Ubuntu, install the following packages using `apt` and `pip`:
```shell
sudo apt install -y doxygen graphviz python3 python3-pip sphinx
python3 -m pip install breathe recommonmark graphviz sphinx-rtd-theme
```

Build the documentation:
```shell
ci/build_docs.sh [build folder]
```
Default build folder is 'build'.

#### 4. Build and run Samples

For instructions on how to build samples from source and run them, see the [Samples](samples/README.md) documentation.

#### 5. Run Tests

Install the dependencies required for running the tests:
- python3, python3-pip: to run python bindings tests
- torch: dependencies needed by python bindings tests

On Ubuntu >= 20.04, install the following packages using `apt` and `pip`:
```shell
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip
python3 -m pip install pytest torch numpy==1.26
```

The tests are in `<buildtree>/bin`. You can run the script below to run all tests at once. Here's an example when build tree is created in `build-rel`:
```shell
build-rel/bin/run_tests.sh
```

#### 6. Package installers and Python Wheels

Package installers

Installers can be generated using the following cpack command once you have successfully built the project:
```shell
cd build-rel
cpack .
```
This will generate in the build directory both Debian installers and tarballs (\*.tar.xz), needed for integration in other distros.

For a fine-grained choice of what installers to generate, the full syntax is:

```shell
cpack . -G [DEB|TXZ]
```
- DEB for Debian packages
- TXZ for \*.tar.xz tarballs.

Python Wheels

By default during the `release` build, Python bindings and wheels are created for the available CUDA version and the specified Python version(s). The wheels are stored in `build-rel/pythonX.Y/wheel` folder, where `build-rel` is the build directory used to build the release build and `X` and `Y` are Python major and minor versions.

The built wheels can be installed using pip.
For example, to install the Python wheel built for CUDA 12.x, Python 3.10 on Linux x86_64 systems:
```shell
pip install cvcuda_cu12-<x.x.x>-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
```

### CV-CUDA Make Operator Tool

The `mkop.sh` script is a powerful tool for creating a scaffold for new operators in the CV-CUDA library. It automates several tasks, ensuring consistency and saving time.

#### Features of `mkop.sh`:

1. **Operator Stub Creation**: Generates no-op (no-operation) operator templates, which serve as a starting point for implementing new functionalities.

2. **File Customization**: Modifies template files to include the new operator's name, ensuring consistent naming conventions across the codebase.

3. **CMake Integration**: Adds the new operator files to the appropriate CMakeLists, facilitating seamless compilation and integration into the build system.

4. **Python Bindings**: Creates Python wrapper stubs for the new operator, allowing it to be used within Python environments.

5. **Test Setup**: Generates test files for both C++ and Python, enabling immediate development of unit tests for the new operator.

#### How to Use `mkop.sh`:

Run the script with the desired operator name. The script assumes it's located in `~/cvcuda/tools/mkop`.

```shell
./mkop.sh [Operator Name]
```

If the script is run from a different location, provide the path to the CV-CUDA root directory.

```shell
./mkop.sh [Operator Name] [CV-CUDA root]
```

**NOTE**: The first letter of the new operator name is captitalized where needed to match the rest of the file structures.

#### Process Details:

- **Initial Setup**: The script begins by validating the input and setting up necessary variables. It then capitalizes the first letter of the operator name to adhere to naming conventions.

- **Template Modification**: It processes various template files (`Public.h`, `PrivateImpl.cpp`, etc.), replacing placeholders with the new operator name. This includes adjusting file headers, namespaces, and function signatures.

- **CMake and Python Integration**: The script updates `CMakeLists.txt` files and Python module files to include the new operator, ensuring it's recognized by the build system and Python interface.

- **Testing Framework**: Finally, it sets up test files for both C++ and Python, allowing developers to immediately start writing tests for the new operator.
