v0.14.0-beta
============

Release Highlights
------------------

CV-CUDA v0.14.0 includes the following changes:​

* **New Features**:​

  * Added support for SBSA ARM/Grace cuda 12, including ManyLinux2014-compliant Python wheel generation

    * We do not provide SBSA-compatible aarch64_cu11 packages yet, this will be addressed in an upcoming release

    * aarch64_cu12 packages distributed on Github and Pypi are the SBSA-compatible ones. Jetson builds can be found in explicitly named "Jetson" archives in Github release assets.

  * Added support for compiling NVCV on QNX

  * Added support for VYUY and YUV8p formats in NVCV

  * Improved test coverage for NVCV and operators

  * Minor corrections to documentation

* **Bug Fixes**:​

  * Made Python cache thread-local to avoid race conditions and potential crashes in Python gilless multithreaded setups


Compatibility and Known Limitations
-----------------------------------

* Starting with v0.14, aarch64_cu12 packages (deb, tar.xz or wheels) distributed on Github (release "assets") and Pypi are the SBSA-compatible ones. Jetson builds (deb, tar.xz, whl) can be found in explicitly named "Jetson" archives in Github release assets.

* We do not provide SBSA-compatible aarch64_cu11 packages yet, this will be addressed in an upcoming release.
