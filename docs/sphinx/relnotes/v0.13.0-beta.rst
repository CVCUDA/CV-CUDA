v0.13.0-beta
============

Release Highlights
------------------

CV-CUDA v0.13.0 includes ManyLinux 2014 compliant wheels alongside the following changes:​

* **New Features**:​

  * Added Python wheel generation compliant with ManyLinux 2014 and PyPI standards.

    * The multiple python version wheels are now unified into a single wheel file per CUDA version​.

    * Included scripts to build two ManyLinux 2014 Docker images (CUDA 11, CUDA 12) for build, and four Ubuntu images (20.04 and 22.04 x CUDA 11, CUDA 12) for testing.

    * Python wheels must be built within the ManyLinux 2014 docker images to guarantee ManyLinux2014 compliance.

* **Bug Fixes**:​

  * Upgraded pybind11 to version 2.13.6 for improved compatibility and functionality.​

    * Resolved Python ABI compatibility issues present in previous versions by upgrading pybind11 reported in previous versions.​
