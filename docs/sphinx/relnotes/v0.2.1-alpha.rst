.. _v0.2.1-alpha:

Alpha.1
=======

General
-------
- Added [DLPack](https://dmlc.github.io/dlpack/latest/) interop support to Python
- Added CV-CUDA build package for various Python versions
- Updated documentation to include [NVIDIA VPF](https://github.com/NVIDIA/VideoProcessingFramework) update
- Downgraded C++ version required from [20](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support/20) to [17](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support/17)
- Made public headers compatible with [C++11](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support/11)
- Changed default CUDA stream in Python to be 0
- Removed library build dependency on [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)
- Relaxed `nvcv::Tensor` bit restrictions on strides
- Updated Segmentation sample app with [NVIDIA VPF](https://github.com/NVIDIA/VideoProcessingFramework) and Joint Bilateral Filter

New Operators
-------------
- Joint Bilateral Filter

Improved Testing
----------------
- Full operator test coverage for interleaved (HWC) and planar (CHW) tensors
- Removed Numba dependency on tests

Bug Fixes
---------
- [BUG #25 Addressed](https://github.com/CVCUDA/CV-CUDA/issues/25) `TypeError: as_tensor(): incompatible function arguments. The following argument types are supported`
- [BUG #26 Addressed](https://github.com/CVCUDA/CV-CUDA/issues/26) `libdl-2.17_stub.so: file format not recognized; treating as linker script`
- [BUG #28 Addressed](https://github.com/CVCUDA/CV-CUDA/issues/28) `cannot find -lcvcuda`
- Fixed memory leak from exception thrown by constructor
- Fixed CMake code generation for header compatibility tests
- Fixed reformated from CHW to NHWC error
- Fixed `NVCV_ASSERT_STATUS` macro failing to compile prompt added when testing for exception
- Tensor shapes must be exported as tuples, not lists, in Python
- `cudaIllegalMemoryAddress` prompt added in Python tests when GPU is under load
- `cudaMallocs` prompt added in pipelines driven by Python incur performance penalty
